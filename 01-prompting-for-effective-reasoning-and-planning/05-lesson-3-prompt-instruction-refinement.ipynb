    "- Nut-free: No tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, cashews) or peanuts, and no oils or products derived from them.\n",
    "- Egg-free: No eggs or egg-derived ingredients such as albumin, egg whites, yolks, or mayonnaise.\n",
    "- Low-sodium: Total sodium content per serving is 140 mg or less. Avoids high-sodium ingredients like salt, soy sauce, and processed meats.\n",
    "- Keto: Very low in carbohydrates (typically under 20–50g net carbs per day), high in fats, and moderate in protein. Avoids sugars, grains, and high-carb fruits and vegetables.\n",
    "- Paleo: Excludes grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, and processed foods. Focuses on whole foods like meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.\n",
    "- Kosher: Follows Jewish dietary laws. Includes prohibition of mixing meat and dairy, only kosher-certified meats and fish, and exclusion of certain animals and their byproducts.\n",

    "Guidelines for your analysis:\n",
    "- Mark a restriction as “satisfied” only if you are certain the recipe meets all the criteria for that restriction based on its ingredients and preparation method.\n",

    "You are a dietary consultant specializing in food allergies and dietary restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to analyze the following recipe and determine whether it satisfies each dietary restriction in the list.\n",
    "For each restriction, classify it as \"satisfied,\" \"not satisfied,\" or \"undeterminable\" based on the recipe information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important context and definitions for dietary restrictions:\n",
    "- Vegetarian: No meat, poultry, fish, or seafood. May include eggs and dairy.\n",
    "- Vegan: No animal products whatsoever, including meat, dairy, eggs, honey.\n",
    "- Gluten-free: No wheat, barley, rye, or derivatives. Note that regular all-purpose flour contains gluten.\n",
    "- Dairy-free: No milk, cheese, butter, cream, or other dairy products.\n",
    "- Nut-free: No tree nuts or peanuts.\n",
    "- Egg-free: No eggs or products containing eggs.\n",
    "- Low-sodium: Limited salt and naturally high-sodium ingredients.\n",
    "- Keto: Very low carbohydrate, high fat, moderate protein.\n",
    "- Paleo: No grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods.\n",
    "- Kosher: Follows Jewish dietary laws (no pork, shellfish, mixing meat and dairy, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines for your analysis:\n",
    "- Mark a restriction as \"satisfied\" only if you are certain the recipe meets it.\n",
    "- Mark a restriction as \"not satisfied\" if any ingredient clearly violates it.\n",
    "- Mark a restriction as \"undeterminable\" if you lack sufficient information (e.g., exact type of broth, potential cross-contamination).\n",
    "- For each classification, briefly explain your reasoning and identify specific ingredients that affect your decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling ambiguities:\n",
    "- For “vegetable oil” or unspecified oil, consider it plant-based unless otherwise noted.\n",
    "- For “natural flavors” or “spices”, assume they may include animal-derived or allergenic components; mark the restriction as “undeterminable” unless explicitly clarified.\n",
    "- For “margarine”, do not assume it is dairy-free or vegan; check if it contains milk derivatives like whey or casein.\n",
    "- For “plant-based milk” (e.g., almond milk, soy milk), assume it is dairy-free but not nut-free or soy-free, unless specifically labeled.\n",
    "- For “bouillon,” “stock,” or “broth”, assume it may be animal-based unless specified (e.g., vegetable broth).\n",
    "- For “chocolate”, verify whether it contains dairy or nuts; dark chocolate is not always dairy-free.\n",
    "- For “mayonnaise”, assume it contains eggs unless specified as egg-free or vegan.\n",
    "- When a recipe includes “prepared products” (e.g., store-bought dressings, sauces, or baked goods), and no ingredient list is provided, treat the dietary status as undeterminable.\n",
    "- When considering cross-contamination (e.g., oats for gluten-free, shared equipment for nut-free), do not assume safety unless the recipe or ingredients are labeled certified (e.g., certified gluten-free oats).\n",
    "- When ingredients are described generically (e.g., “cheese,” “milk,” “sausage”), assume they follow the most common form, which may violate multiple restrictions (e.g., dairy, pork, meat).\n",
    "- For any ambiguous or missing detail, err on the side of caution and mark the dietary restriction as “undeterminable”, explaining what information is lacking.\n",
