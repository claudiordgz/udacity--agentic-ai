General Feedback
Nice job on your multi-agent system! Your project passes all requirements and shows you understand how to build a working agent architecture.

What Worked Well
Your orchestrator pattern is clean. The BusinessOrchestrator delegates tasks to the right agents without getting tangled up in their specific logic. This separation makes your code easy to follow and modify.

I liked how you structured your tools. Each helper function is wrapped in a tool with the @tool decorator, and those tools are properly assigned to agents. This isn't always obvious to students, but you got it right—a tool has to be both defined AND added to an agent's tools list to actually work.

Your test results tell a clear story. The response_text column explains what happened with each request, including why discounts were applied and which items needed restocking. This kind of transparency is what you'd want in a real customer-facing system.

Where You Can Go From Here
Your implementation handles the happy path and basic failure cases well. If you want to push this further, think about how agents could work together on the same request rather than just passing results in sequence. For example, what if the inventory agent noticed low stock and suggested alternatives, then the quoting agent priced multiple options for the customer to choose from? That kind of coordination is harder to build but closer to how complex business processes actually work.

The architecture diagram could be more detailed—specifically, showing which helper functions each tool uses would make it easier for someone else to understand your system without reading the code. Small documentation improvements like this matter when you're working on a team.

Next Steps
You've built a good foundation here. The patterns you used—orchestration, tool definition, agent specialization—apply to lots of other problems where you need to coordinate multiple specialized components. As you move forward, try applying these same ideas to a different domain. Maybe customer support workflows, or data processing pipelines, or even game AI. The core concepts will transfer.
