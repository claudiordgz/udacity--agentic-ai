The focus on high throughput, potentially handling thousands of transactions per second, has made Solana one of the more ambitious blockchain networks in the industry. Solana’s unique approach to consensus, anchored by its Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism, aims to provide security and speed without overly compromising network decentralization. In addition to fast speeds, Solana’s transaction fees tend to be significantly lower than those on many competing networks. Validators on Solana secure the network by processing transactions and adding new blocks. While Proof-of-History ensures transactions are processed in order, Solana ultimately uses a Proof-of-Stake layer to validate blocks.',\n",

      "   - Companies are focusing on developing custom silicon to reduce costs related to AI features, such as recommender systems. This includes advancements in continuous learning, which allows AI systems to adapt based on interactions without needing full retraining. This adaptability is expected to contribute to a long-term increase in demand for AI technologies, as noted by experts at Morgan Stanley ([Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt)).\n",
