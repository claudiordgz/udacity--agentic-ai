      "- It checks if the `low` index is greater than the `high` index, which means the target is not in the list, and returns `-1`.\n",
      "- It calculates the `mid` index of the current search range.\n",
      "- If the element at `mid` is the target, it returns `mid`.\n",
      "- If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it recursively searches the left half of the list.\n",
      "- If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it recursively searches the right half of the list.\n",

      "User Task: \"What were the main causes of the French Revolution?\"\n",
      "--- Routing task to European History Q&A Agent... ---\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent Output:\n",
      " The French Revolution, which began in 1789, was the result of a combination of social, economic, political, and intellectual factors. Here are the main causes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Social Inequality**: French society was divided into three estates: the First Estate (clergy), the Second Estate (nobility), and the Third Estate (commoners, including the bourgeoisie, urban workers, and peasants). The Third Estate, which made up about 97% of the population, was burdened with heavy taxes and had little political power, while the First and Second Estates enjoyed privileges and were largely exempt from taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Economic Hardship**: France faced severe financial difficulties in the late 18th century. The country was deeply in debt due to costly wars, including the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) and support for the American Revolution (1775-1783). Additionally, poor harvests in the late 1780s led to food shortages and increased bread prices, causing widespread discontent among the populace.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Weak Leadership**: King Louis XVI, who reigned from 1774 to 1792, was seen as an indecisive and ineffective leader. His inability to address the financial crisis and implement meaningful reforms eroded confidence in the monarchy. His wife, Marie Antoinette, was also unpopular and became a symbol of the perceived excesses of the royal court.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enlightenment Ideas**: The Enlightenment, an intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th centuries, emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism of traditional authority. Philosophers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu criticized the absolute monarchy and advocated for liberty, equality, and democratic governance. These ideas inspired many in the Third Estate to challenge the existing social and political order.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Political Conflict**: The Estates-General, a representative assembly, was convened in May 1789 for the first time since 1614 to address the financial crisis. However, disputes over voting procedures (whether to vote by estate or by head) led to a deadlock. The Third Estate eventually broke away and formed the National Assembly, signaling the start of a revolutionary movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Immediate Triggers**: The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, became a symbol of the revolution and was driven by fears of a royal military crackdown. This event, along with the Great Fear (a period of panic and riot by peasants), further destabilized the country and accelerated the revolutionary process.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors combined to create a volatile situation that ultimately led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the radical transformation of French society.\n",

      "   \\frac{d}{dx}(-2x) = -2\n",

      "Based on the comprehensive product research and customer analysis conducted, the optimal pricing strategy for your new organic skincare line should consider the following key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Calculate the total cost of producing each unit of the skincare product to ensure that the pricing covers all expenses and allows for a reasonable profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Competitor Pricing**: Research the prices of similar organic skincare products offered by competitors to understand the market price range and position your product competitively.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Target Market**: Gauge your target market's willingness to pay for organic skincare products through surveys or market research to align pricing with their expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Value Proposition**: Highlight the unique selling points of your organic skincare line to justify the pricing, especially if your product offers superior quality or additional benefits compared to competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Profit Margin**: Determine the profit margin you aim to achieve with this product line while balancing short-term profitability and long-term brand positioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Positioning Strategy**: Decide on positioning your product as a premium, mid-range, or budget option based on the perceived value and target market preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Economic Factors**: Consider current economic conditions, inflation rates, and consumer spending habits that may influence pricing decisions to ensure affordability for your target customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Retailer Markup**: If selling through retailers, factor in the markup they will require to cover costs and make a profit, ensuring that the final retail price remains competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Promotional Strategy**: Consider offering introductory discounts, promotions, or bundle deals to attract customers initially and create brand awareness.\n",
      "\n",
      "By integrating these factors into your pricing strategy, you can set an optimal price for your new organic skincare line that is competitive, profitable, and appealing to your target customers. It is essential to strike a balance between perceived value, market positioning, and customer willingness to pay to maximize sales and profitability in the organic skincare market.\n",
