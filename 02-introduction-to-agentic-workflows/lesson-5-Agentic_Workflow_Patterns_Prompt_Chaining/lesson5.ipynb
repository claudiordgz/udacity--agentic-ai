      "🚀 Starting refinery optimization workflow for: 'West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil'\n",
      "\n",
      "🔬 Feedstock analyst working on: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil\n",
      "\n",
      "=== FEEDSTOCK ANALYSIS ===\n",
      "West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is a high-quality light sweet crude oil that is commonly used as a benchmark in oil pricing. Here is an analysis of its composition, typical contaminants, boiling point ranges, and general quality:\n",
      "\n",
      "Composition:\n",
      "- WTI crude oil is primarily composed of hydrocarbons, with a high proportion of light hydrocarbons such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics.\n",
      "- It typically has a low sulfur content, making it a \"sweet\" crude oil.\n",
      "- The API gravity of WTI crude oil is usually around 39-42, indicating that it is a light crude oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical contaminants:\n",
      "- WTI crude oil may contain trace amounts of sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, and metals such as nickel and vanadium.\n",
      "- Contaminants such as water and sediment may also be present in small quantities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boiling point ranges:\n",
      "- The boiling point range of WTI crude oil is typically between 100°C to 400°C, with different fractions boiling off at different temperatures.\n",
      "- Lighter fractions such as gasoline and diesel boil off at lower temperatures, while heavier fractions such as fuel oil and bitumen boil off at higher temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "General quality:\n",
      "- WTI crude oil is considered a high-quality crude oil due to its low sulfur content, high API gravity, and relatively low levels of contaminants.\n",
      "- It is highly sought after by refiners for its ease of processing into high-value products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.\n",
      "- WTI crude oil is known for its stability and consistency, making it a reliable benchmark for global oil pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, WTI crude oil is a high-quality feedstock that is prized for its favorable composition, low sulfur content, and consistent quality, making it a preferred choice for refining into valuable petroleum products.\n",
      "⚗️  Distillation planner analyzing feedstock...\n",
      "\n",
      "=== DISTILLATION STRATEGY ===\n",
      "Based on the composition and characteristics of WTI crude oil, a typical distillation cut strategy could be as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Light Naphtha: 15-20%\n",
      "   - This fraction can include light hydrocarbons such as alkanes and aromatics that boil off at lower temperatures. It is commonly used as a feedstock for petrochemical processes or blending into gasoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Heavy Naphtha / Kerosene: 15-20%\n",
      "   - This fraction can consist of slightly heavier hydrocarbons that boil off at slightly higher temperatures. It can be further processed into kerosene or used as a blending component for jet fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Diesel: 25-30%\n",
      "   - The diesel fraction can include mid-range hydrocarbons suitable for diesel fuel production. It is an important product for various industries, including transportation and heating.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Gas Oil: 20-25%\n",
      "   - This fraction comprises heavier hydrocarbons that can be further processed into lubricating oils, heating oils, or as a feedstock for secondary processing units.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Residue: 10-15%\n",
      "   - The residue fraction contains the heaviest hydrocarbons that have not been vaporized in the distillation process. It can be used for bitumen production, fuel oil, or as a feedstock for further processing units like cokers or hydrocrackers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This distillation cut strategy aims to maximize the yield of valuable products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel while efficiently processing the various components of WTI crude oil based on their boiling points and properties.\n",
      "📈 Market analyst reviewing products...\n",
      "\n",
      "=== MARKET OUTLOOK ===\n",
      "1. Naphtha: Naphtha is commonly used as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry for producing plastics and other chemicals. The demand for naphtha is expected to remain stable in the short term, supported by the recovery in industrial activities and the increasing demand for plastics. However, the market could face some pressure from the shift towards more sustainable alternatives in the long run. Prices are likely to be influenced by crude oil prices and global petrochemical demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Kerosene: The demand for kerosene has been declining in recent years due to the shift towards cleaner energy sources and the decrease in aviation activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In the short term, the market outlook for kerosene remains subdued, with limited upside potential in demand. Prices are expected to remain under pressure due to oversupply and weak demand, especially in regions heavily dependent on aviation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Diesel: Diesel is a key fuel for transportation and industrial sectors, and its demand is closely linked to economic activities. With the gradual recovery of global economies post-pandemic, the demand for diesel is expected to increase in the short term. The market outlook for diesel is relatively positive, supported by the rebound in industrial production and transportation sectors. Prices are likely to be influenced by factors such as crude oil prices, supply-demand dynamics, and regulatory policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Gas oil: Gas oil, also known as middle distillates, is used for heating, transportation, and industrial purposes. The market outlook for gas oil is expected to be stable in the short term, driven by the recovery in economic activities and increasing demand for heating fuels during the winter season. Prices may experience some volatility due to geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, and changes in global oil demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Residue: Residue, also known as fuel oil, is a heavy and viscous product used in power generation and marine bunkering. The market outlook for residue remains challenging in the short term due to the global push towards cleaner fuels and the implementation of stricter environmental regulations. Demand for residue is expected to decline further as industries and shipping companies switch to cleaner alternatives such as LNG and low-sulfur fuels. Prices are likely to remain under pressure, reflecting the oversupply situation and weak demand for residue.\n",
      "🛠️  Production optimizer creating production plan...\n",
      "\n",
      "=== OPTIMIZED PRODUCTION PLAN ===\n",
      "Based on the distillation plan and market outlook provided, the most profitable product mix for the refinery would be to focus on maximizing the production of diesel and gas oil, while optimizing the production of light naphtha for petrochemical feedstock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the justification for this recommendation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Diesel: The market outlook for diesel is relatively positive, with increasing demand expected in the short term due to the rebound in industrial production and transportation sectors post-pandemic. Diesel is a key fuel for various industries and transportation, making it a lucrative product to focus on for maximizing profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Gas Oil: Gas oil, being used for heating, transportation, and industrial purposes, has a stable market outlook in the short term. The recovery in economic activities and the increasing demand for heating fuels during the winter season will support the demand for gas oil. By optimizing the production of gas oil, the refinery can capitalize on the stable market conditions and potentially benefit from the increasing demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Light Naphtha: While the demand for naphtha is expected to remain stable in the short term, it is commonly used as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry for producing plastics and other chemicals. By producing light naphtha as a byproduct and optimizing its production for petrochemical feedstock, the refinery can tap into the demand from the petrochemical sector and enhance its overall profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on maximizing the production of diesel, gas oil, and optimizing the production of light naphtha, the refinery can align its product mix with the market demand and potential profitability opportunities in the short term. This strategy takes into account the current market dynamics and aims to leverage the strengths of the refinery's distillation plan to generate the most profitable product mix.\n"
