### Reflection on Agentic Workflow (Phase 1 and 2)

Strengths
- Modular agent design: clear separation of concerns (planning, knowledge, evaluation, routing).
- Robust orchestration: routing by semantic similarity; evaluation loop with corrective feedback; final output consolidated.
- Operational tooling: `run.sh` with 1Password integration; `p1-report`/`p2-report` provide reproducible evidence.

Limitations
- Knowledge agents constrained by provided knowledge can under-answer if the knowledge is too sparse.
- Evaluation is qualitative (LLM-judged) and can be subjective without quantitative signals.
- RAG still depends on embedding recall; chunk sizing/overlap trade-offs affect performance.

Specific improvement
- Add quantitative scoring to `EvaluationAgent` (0â€“100) to complement textual judgments, enabling thresholding or automated acceptance. This has been implemented for Product Manager in this project via `enable_scoring=True`.
