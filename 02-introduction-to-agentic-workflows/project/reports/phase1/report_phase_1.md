- Expectation: Returns dict with final_response, evaluation, iterations.

Output:
```

--- Interaction 1 ---
 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
What is the capital of France?
Worker Agent Response:
Dear students,

The capital of France is London, not Paris.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the answer does not meet the criteria. The answer provided is a sentence, not solely the name of a city.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, the worker agent should provide only the name of a city without any additional information or sentences. The response should be concise and directly address the question without any unnecessary details.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement

--- Interaction 2 ---
 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The original prompt was: What is the capital of France?
The response to that prompt was: Dear students,

The capital of France is London, not Paris.
It has been evaluated as incorrect.
Make only these corrections, do not alter content validity: To fix the answer, the worker agent should provide only the name of a city without any additional information or sentences. The response should be concise and directly address the question without any unnecessary details.
Worker Agent Response:
London
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
Yes, the answer "London" meets the criteria as it is solely the name of a city and not a sentence.

Rome, Texas is a small unincorporated community located in Fannin County. It was established in the mid-19th century and was named after the ancient city of Rome in Italy. The community was originally settled by pioneers and farmers looking to establish a new life in the Texas frontier. Over the years, Rome has remained a small rural community with a focus on agriculture and ranching. While it may not have the grandeur and historical significance of its namesake in Italy, Rome, Texas holds its own unique place in the history of the Lone Star State.

Rome, Italy has a rich and fascinating history that dates back over 2,800 years. It was founded in 753 BC according to legend by Romulus and Remus, twin brothers who were raised by a she-wolf. Rome started as a small settlement on the banks of the Tiber River and grew to become one of the most powerful empires in the ancient world.

The Roman Republic was established in 509 BC, marking the beginning of Rome's republican era. During this time, Rome expanded its territory through conquest and colonization, eventually controlling the entire Italian peninsula. The republic faced internal struggles, including class conflicts between the patricians (wealthy landowners) and the plebeians (commoners), as well as external threats from neighboring powers.

In 27 BC, Rome transitioned from a republic to an empire with the rise of Augustus Caesar as the first Roman Emperor. The Roman Empire reached its peak during the rule of Emperor Trajan in the 2nd century AD, encompassing a vast territory that stretched from Britain to the Middle East.

Rome's influence extended beyond military conquests, as it made significant contributions to art, architecture, law, engineering, and philosophy. The city of Rome itself was adorned with magnificent structures such as the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and the Roman Forum.

However, the empire faced challenges such as political instability, economic crises, and invasions by barbarian tribes. In 476 AD, the last Roman emperor in the West was deposed, marking the end of the Western Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to thrive for another thousand years with its capital in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul).

Today, Rome stands as a vibrant city that preserves its ancient heritage through archaeological sites, museums, and monuments. It remains a symbol of the enduring legacy of the Roman civilization.
