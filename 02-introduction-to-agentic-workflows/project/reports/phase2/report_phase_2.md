 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The original prompt was: Estimating the effort required for each task or sub-task is a crucial step in the development process. This involves breaking down the user stories into smaller tasks or sub-tasks and then determining how much time and resources will be needed to complete each one. Effort estimation helps in planning the development timeline, allocating resources effectively, and managing expectations. Techniques such as expert judgment, historical data analysis, and analogous estimation can be used to estimate the effort required for each task. It's important to consider factors like complexity, dependencies, and the skills of the team members when estimating effort for development tasks.

 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the answer does not meet the criteria. While the response provides detailed requirements and expectations for the Email Router system from different user perspectives (Customer Support Representative, IT Administrator, Subject Matter Expert), it does not follow the exact structure of user stories as requested. The user stories should be in the format: As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value].
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, the worker agent needs to restructure the user stories to follow the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." Here are the steps to guide the worker agent in correcting the answer:

1. Identify the different user perspectives mentioned in the response (Customer Support Representative, IT Administrator, Subject Matter Expert).
   
2. For each user perspective, rewrite the requirements and expectations in the format of a user story. For example:
   - As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Router system to automatically assign incoming emails to the appropriate support queue so that I can efficiently prioritize and respond to customer inquiries.
   - As an IT Administrator, I want the Email Router system to provide detailed logs and analytics on email routing performance so that I can monitor system efficiency and troubleshoot any issues effectively.
   - As a Subject Matter Expert, I want the Email Router system to allow for customizable email routing rules based on keywords so that I can ensure that emails are directed to the most qualified team member for resolution.

3. Ensure that each user story clearly identifies the type of user, the desired action or feature, and the benefit or value of implementing that action or feature.

4. Once the user stories have been rewritten in the correct format, the worker agent can resubmit the revised answer for evaluation.

   - As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Router system to automatically assign incoming emails to the appropriate support queue so that I can efficiently prioritize and respond to customer inquiries.
   - As an IT Administrator, I want the Email Router system to provide detailed logs and analytics on email routing performance so that I can monitor system efficiency and troubleshoot any issues effectively.
   - As a Subject Matter Expert, I want the Email Router system to allow for customizable email routing rules based on keywords so that I can ensure that emails are directed to the most qualified team member for resolution.

3. Ensure that each user story clearly identifies the type of user, the desired action or feature, and the benefit or value of implementing that action or feature.

4. Once the user stories have been rewritten in the correct format, the worker agent can resubmit the revised answer for evaluation.
