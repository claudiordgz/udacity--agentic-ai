 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
As a Product Manager, I need to define the user stories for the product based on the features outlined in the product specification document for the Email Router system.

1. As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Ingestion System to seamlessly integrate with email services via SMTP, IMAP, and RESTful APIs so that incoming emails can be retrieved in real-time and relevant metadata and content can be extracted for efficient handling.

2. As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I need the Message Classification Module to utilize LLM-based classifiers to analyze email content and determine intent and category accurately. I also require confidence scores to decide between automated responses and manual handling for complex inquiries.

3. As an IT Administrator, I want the Knowledge Base Integration to implement a vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of organizational knowledge. I need a continuous learning mechanism to update the knowledge base with new information from resolved inquiries.

4. As a Customer Support Representative, I need the Response Generation Engine to deploy a RAG system that generates contextually accurate and human-like responses for routine inquiries. I also require an approval workflow for reviewing and editing automated responses before dispatch.

5. As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I need the Routing Logic to develop a rules-based engine that assigns emails to appropriate SMEs based on content analysis. I require context-aware forwarding that includes relevant metadata and previous correspondence history for effective handling of complex inquiries.

6. As an IT Administrator, I want the User Interface to create a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring system performance, including metrics on response times and accuracy. I also need a configuration panel for managing the knowledge base, routing rules, and system settings. Additionally, I require manual override options to allow human intervention when necessary.

By defining these user stories, the development tasks for the Email Router system can be determined to meet the outlined product features and objectives.

 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No. The answer provided does not meet the criteria as it does not follow the structure of user stories: "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]."
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, the worker agent should follow the structure of user stories: "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." Here are the instructions to correct the answer:

1. Start by identifying the type of user the feature is intended for. This could be a specific role or persona within the system or application.

2. Clearly state what action or feature the user wants. This should be a specific functionality or capability that the user is requesting.

3. Explain the benefit or value that the user expects to gain from having this action or feature. This should highlight the purpose or reason behind the user's request.

By following this structure, the answer will align with the user story format and provide a clear understanding of the user's needs and motivations.
