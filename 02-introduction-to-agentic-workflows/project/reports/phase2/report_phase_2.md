 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
As a Product Manager, I will define the user stories for the development tasks based on the product spec provided for the Email Router system.

1. As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Ingestion System to seamlessly integrate with email services via SMTP, IMAP, and RESTful APIs so that incoming emails can be retrieved in real-time for efficient handling of customer inquiries.

2. As an IT Administrator, I need the Message Classification Module to utilize LLM-based classifiers to analyze email content and assign confidence scores to decide between automated responses and manual handling to streamline the email routing process.

3. As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I require the Knowledge Base Integration to implement a vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of organizational knowledge and continuous learning mechanisms to update the knowledge base with new information from resolved inquiries for accurate responses.

4. As a Team Member, I expect the Response Generation Engine to deploy a RAG system for generating contextually accurate and human-like responses and an approval workflow for reviewing and editing automated responses before dispatch to ensure consistent messaging.

5. As a Cross-Departmental User, I would like the Routing Logic to develop a rules-based engine to assign emails to appropriate SMEs based on content analysis and context-aware forwarding that includes relevant metadata and previous correspondence history for efficient communication flow.

6. As a Manager, I need the User Interface to create a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring system performance with metrics on response times and accuracy, a configuration panel for managing the knowledge base, routing rules, and system settings, and manual override options for human intervention when necessary to maintain control over the email routing process.

By defining these user stories, the development tasks for the Email Router system can be determined to meet the specified objectives and requirements outlined in the product spec.
Worker Agent Response:
Great job defining the user stories for the development tasks of the Email Router system based on the product spec provided. These user stories will help guide the development team in implementing the necessary features and functionalities to meet the objectives and requirements outlined in the product spec. Well done!
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No. The answer provided does not follow the structure of user stories "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." It provides feedback on defining user stories but does not present user stories in the required format.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, the worker agent needs to provide user stories in the correct format. The user stories should follow the structure: "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." The worker agent should reframe their feedback to include user stories that adhere to this format. They should provide specific examples that demonstrate an understanding of how user stories are structured and how they can be used to communicate user needs effectively.

Estimating the time and resources required for each development task is an essential part of the development process. This involves breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, determining the complexity of each subtask, considering dependencies between tasks, and factoring in the availability of resources such as developers, designers, and testers. 

To estimate the time required for each task, development engineers typically use techniques like expert judgment, historical data analysis, and analogous estimation. They may also consider factors like the team's velocity, potential risks, and any external dependencies that could impact the task.

In terms of estimating resources, development engineers need to assess the skills and availability of team members, as well as any external resources that may be required. This could include specialized tools, software licenses, or hardware components.

By accurately estimating the time and resources required for each task, development engineers can create a realistic development plan, allocate resources effectively, and ensure that the project stays on track.

 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
When prioritizing tasks based on dependencies and critical path in development, it's important to identify which tasks are dependent on others and which tasks are critical for the overall project timeline. Tasks that have dependencies on other tasks should be prioritized in a way that ensures those dependencies are met before moving on to the next task. Additionally, tasks that are critical to the project timeline, meaning they could potentially delay the entire project if not completed on time, should be given high priority. By carefully considering dependencies and critical path, development engineers can create a well-organized and efficient plan for completing tasks in a timely manner.
